SQL Practice 1:


CREATE TABLE friends (
id INTEGER,
name TEXT,
birthday DATE
);

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday)
VALUES (1, 'Jane Doe', '1990-05-30');

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday)
VALUES (2, 'Chuck', '1986-10-31');

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday)
VALUES(3, 'Austin', '1988-04-01');

UPDATE friends
SET name = 'Jane Smith'
WHERE id = 1;

ALTER TABLE friends
ADD COLUMN email
TEXT;

UPDATE friends
SET email = "jane@codeacademy.com"
WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM friends
WHERE name = "Jane Smith";

SELECT * FROM friends;




















SQL Practice 2:
SELECT * FROM nomnom;


SELECT DISTINCT neighborhood FROM nomnom;


SELECT DISTINCT cuisine FROM nomnom;


SELECT * FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Chinese';


SELECT * FROM nomnom WHERE review > 4;


SELECT * FROM nomnom WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' AND price = '$$$';


SELECT * FROM nomnom WHERE name LIKE '%meatball%';


SELECT * FROM nomnom WHERE neighborhood = 'Brooklyn' OR neighborhood = 'Downtown' OR neighborhood = 'Chinatown';


SELECT * FROM nomnom WHERE health IS NULL;


SELECT * FROM nomnom ORDER BY review DESC LIMIT 10;


SELECT name,
CASE 
WHEN review > 4.5 THEN 'Extraordinary'
WHEN review > 4 THEN 'Excellent'
WHEN review > 3 THEN 'Good'
WHEN review > 2 THEN 'Fair'
ELSE 'Poor'
END AS rating
FROM nomnom;
